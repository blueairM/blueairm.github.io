    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="my-journey-with-mathematics">My Journey with Mathematics</h1><p>It was the summer of 2014. Holding my college entrance exam resultsin hand, I walked up to my high school homeroom teacher and mathinstructor, Mr. Lei Yunhai, and said, "Mr. Lei, I want to studymathematics." A look of joy crossed his face, but after a brief pause,he replied, "You might want to consider statistics." Back then, big dataand artificial intelligence hadn't yet become the buzzwords they aretoday, and statistics wasn't a trendy discipline. Yet, in my youthfulignorance, I filled out my college application form with the words:<em>Applied Statistics.</em></p><h1 id="planting-the-seeds-of-mathematics">Planting the Seeds ofMathematics</h1><p>In college, I met a remarkable professor, Mr. Wang Shutang, whotaught us topology. His lectures were full of students who admire himand he was always peppered with his personal reflections on academicinquiry: "Science requires a spirit of dedication. Mathematics is aboutdistilling the essence of ideas from the works of ourpredecessors-separating the wheat from the chaff, eliminating the falseto retain the true, abstracting and generalizing. It's crucial forscience to cultivate keen intuition and a vision that transcends merelogic..."</p><p>Up until then, my perception of mathematics was tinged with a faintsense of mystique, shaped by the glowing tributes of Newton and Gauss.Professor Wang's words lit a fire in me. His philosophy resonateddeeply, and the seed of a passion for research took root in my heart.Even today, I often wake from dreams recalling his wisdom. Looking back,I realize that my life's trajectory began intertwining with mathematicsfrom that moment onward.</p><h1 id="seven-years-of-numbers">Seven Years of Numbers</h1><p>Four years later, I was admitted to graduate school to continuestudying statistics. Seven years passed with a blink of eyes. Along theway, I made lifelong friends and developed a daily rhythm ofmathematical research, spending my days immersed in calculating andproblem-solving.</p><p>To me, there is no boundary between applied mathematics and puremathematics. Applied mathematics provides rich examples, while puremathematics advances theoretical understanding, creating a virtuouscycle. My work in statistics has always swung between tacklingreal-world challenges and revisiting theoretical foundations.Occasionally, I've fantasized about finding a single, all-encompassingsolution to every problem, but I've learned that such shortcuts areillusory.</p><p>I often lost myself in my studies, spending entire days in librariesand study rooms, sometimes forgetting to eat. My first paper was on theKarhunen-Lo'eve theorem, where I classified bivariate random fields andestablished four necessary and sufficient conditions for the non-uniformconvergence of random orthogonal series. At the age of 24, I tasted thesatisfaction of producing original research, gaining confidence in myability to make progress in mathematics.</p><p>My continued engagement with real-world problems led me to observethat a bivariate random field corresponds naturally to a 2-tensor, or arandom matrix. I proposed definitions for four classes of matrix normaldistributions and submitted the findings to <em>Annals ofStatistics.</em> My growing fascination with tensors led me to extendthese results to general matrix rings, reducing the complexity of matrixmultiplication to (O(n^{5/2})) which surpasses the classical (O(n^3)).These three papers marked my entry into mathematical research, but Iknow I owe much of my progress to Professor Wang's inspiring words.</p><h1 id="doctoral-research-and-beyond">Doctoral Research and Beyond</h1><p>My doctoral thesis was titled <em>Generalized AdditiveProcesses,</em> a topic steeped in abstraction. In essence, it sought touncover qualitative shifts arising from the accumulation of quantitativesimilarities among examples. I observed that additive processes,including Markov processes, share a common feature: they all have apredictable compensator. This observation led to the definition of ageneralized additive process as the sum of a predictable process and amartingale, naturally extending the work of Doob and Meyer.</p><p>Once the definition was in place, Br'emaud's 1972 conjecture followedalmost effortlessly. This result, included in my thesis, yielded furtherintriguing corollaries, such as the existence of a cluster process thatis not infinitely divisible. Some may wonder why a seemingly naturaldefinition requires so much groundwork, but I believe that mathematicsderives its strengths from such cumulative efforts. These scatteredresults coalesce into a cohesive whole, as mathematics relies not onitself to advance but on the synthesis of diverse ideas andperspectives.</p><p>Recently, I've turned my attention to harmonic functions andrepresentation theory, exploring their intricacies through practicalexamples. Unlike Professor Wang, whose philosophy laid my basis, I nowpursue my own line of inquiry. Perhaps this is due to my encounters withBuddhism, which has taught me to be devout but not dogmatic. I balancemy academic pursuits with hobbies like singing, running ten kilometers,swimming, and catching up with friends. These activities, along with myresearch, form the tapestry of my life.</p><h1 id="a-vision-for-the-future">A Vision for the Future</h1><p>Next year, I will graduate from the doctoral school. At that time, Ihope to find a position that allows me to continue my research andtranslate books that perhaps inspire me. Above all, I aspire to learnfrom the people I admire. Some have passed on, but their spirit burnsbrightly, like a torch passed from one generation to the next. I don'tseek to become a blazing fire myself; I'm content to be a blade ofgrass-weathering the winds and rains, but growing with each drop ofnourishment.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Neptune was discovered in 1846 as a result of mathematicalcalculation, done independently and practically simultaneously by Adamsand le Verrier. The full story abounds in unexpected twists, and iscomplicated by personal matters, some of them rather painful. There is afascinating account in Professor W. M. Smart's <strong><em>John CouchAdams and the Discovery of Neptune</em></strong>, published by the RoyalAstronomical Society, 1947. I am concerned only with limited parts ofthe field.</p><p>To refresh the reader's memory of what has been said from time totime about the discovery I will begin with some representativequotations. In <strong><em>The Story of the Heavens</em></strong> (1886)Sir Robert Ball has passages:' the name of le Verrier rose to a pinnaclehardly surpassed in any age or country' ... 'profound meditations formany months' ... 'long tand arduous labour guided by consummatemathematical artifice'. The author is not above a bit of popular appealin this book —— 'if the ellipse has not the perfect simplicity of thecircle, it has at least the charm of variety ... an outline of perfectgrace, and an association with ennobling conceptions' —— but on Neptunehe is speaking as a professional. An excellent modern book on thehistory of astronomy has, so late as 1938:' probably the most daringmathematical enterprise of the century ... this amazing task, like whichnothing had ever been attempted before'.</p><p>The immediate reaction was natural enough. Celestial Mechanics ingeneral, and the theory of perturbations in particular, had developedinto a very elaborate and high-brow subject; the problem of explainingthe misbehaviour of Uranus by a new planet was one of 'inverse' theory,and the common feeling was that the problem was difficult up to orbeyond the point of impossibility. One might speculate at some length onreasons for this opinion (one, perhaps was confusion between differentmeanings of the technica term 'insoluble'<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>).When Adams and le Verrier provec the opinion wrong (and after all<strong><em>any</em></strong> mathematical proof is a debunking ofsorts) there was still something to be said for the principle thatdifficulties are what they seem before the event, not after. Certainlyno one would grudge them their resounding fame. (Nor grudge, at a lowerlevel, the luck of a discovery which makes a more sensational impactthan its actual difficulty strictly merits; in point of fact this lucknever does happen to the second-rate.) If the discovery has had a verylong run one must remember that there is a time-lag ; people cannot bealways reconsidering opinions, and having said something once even themost intelligent tend to go on repeating it. The phrase was still invogue that 'only 3 people understand Relativity' at a time whenEddington was complaining that the trouble about Relativity as anexamination subject in 'Part III' was that it was such a softoption.</p><p>In what I am going to say I am far from imputing stupidity to peoplecertainly less stupid than myself. My little <strong><em>jeuzd'esprit</em></strong> are not going to hurt anyone, and I refuse to bedeterred by the fear of being thought disrespectful to great men. I havenot been alone in a lurking suspicion that a much simpler approach mightsucceed. On the one hand, aim at the minimum needed to makeobservational discovery practicable; specifically at the time <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> of conjunction.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Onthe other, forget the high-brow and laborious perturbation theory, andtry 'school mathematics'. (I admit to the human weakness of beingspurred on by the mild piquancy success would have.) To begin with Ifound things oddly elusive (and incidentally committed some grossstupidities). In the end an absurdly simple line emerged: I can imagineits being called a dirty trick, nor would I deny that there is sometruth in the accusation. The only way to make my case is to carry outthe actual 'prediction' of <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>from the observational data, with all the cards on the table (so thatanyone can check against unconscious or conscious faking). I will alsowrite so as to take as many amateurs as possible with me on the littleadventure.</p><p>A planetary 'orbit' is an ellipse with the Sun <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> at a focus, and the radius vector <span class="math inline">\(SP\)</span> sweeps out area at a constant rate(Kepler's second law). An orbit, given its plane, is defined by 4elements, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. The first 3 define thegeometrical ellipse: <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is thesemi-major axis; <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> theeccentricity; <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> the longitudeof perihelion, i.e. with the obvious polar coordinates <span class="math inline">\(r, \theta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the 'longitude' and <span class="math inline">\(\theta=a\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is nearest <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (at an end of the major axis). When weknow <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> we know the 'mean angularvelocity' <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and the associatedperiod <span class="math inline">\(p= 2 \pi/n\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is in fact proportional to <span class="math inline">\(a^{-\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> (Kepler's third law)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>; further the constant rate of areasweeping is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}abn\)</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and twice this rate is identicalwith the angular momentum'<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> (a.m. for short); thishas the differential calculus formula <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\theta\)</span>, and it also is of courseconstant. The 4th element, the 'epoch' <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, is needed to identify the origin of<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>; the exact definition is that<span class="math inline">\(\theta= \alpha\)</span> (perihelion) occursat the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(nt+ \epsilon = \alpha\)</span>.</p><p><span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>'s orbit has a period of 84years, and an eccentricity <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> ofabout <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{20}\)</span>. The effects ofbodies other than <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> can be allowed for, after which we maysuppose that <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and the eventual <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> are the only bodies in the system; wemay also suppose (all this is common form) that the movements are all inone plane. The values of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>(for <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>) at the various times <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (we sometimes write <span class="math inline">\(\theta(t)\)</span> to emphasize that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is 'at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>') may be regarded as the observationalraw material (though of course the actual raw observations are made fromthe Earth). The <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>'s for the various<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are indirect and are much lesswell determined.</p><p>The position in 1845 was that no exact elliptic orbit would fit theobserved 6 over the whole stretch 1780 to 1840.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Thediscrepancies are very small, mostly a few seconds of arc (with a suddenswoop of about 90",see Tablel). The ratio <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>'s mass to that of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (taken as 1) is actually about 1/19000(the Orders of magnitude fit since m radians is about 11").</p><p>In the absence of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> the a.m.<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is constant (as stated abovealias of Kepler's second law); <strong><em>the actual <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> accelerates <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at times earlier than <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> and decelerates it at latertimes</em></strong>. The graph of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>against <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> therefore rises to amaximum at <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{0}\)</span>, and my firstidea was that this would identify. So it would if all observations werewithout error (and the method would have the theoretical advantage ofbeing unaffected by the eccentricities). But the value of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> depends on the <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and the determinations of the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>'s are consequently too uncertain.Though the method fails it rises from the ashes in another form. Forthis a few more preliminaries are needed.</p><p>The numerical data Adams and le Verrier had to work on were not theobserved <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>'s themselves, butthe differences between the observed <span class="math inline">\(\theta(t)\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{B}(t)\)</span> of an elliptic orbitcalculated by Bouvard; the 'discrepancy' <span class="math inline">\(\delta(t)\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> for short) is <span class="math inline">\(\delta(t)=\theta(t)-\theta_{B}(t)\)</span>. [<span class="math inline">\(\theta_{B} (t)\)</span> depends on the 'elements'of <span class="math inline">\(E_{B}\)</span>, and these are subject to'errors'. These errors are among the unknowns that the perturbationtheory has to determine: our method does not mind what they are, as weshall see.] Table I gives the raw <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>'s (given in Adams's paper<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>),together with the values got by running a smooth curve. The treatment ofthe start of the sudden swoop down after the long flat stretch is a bituncertain: I drew my curve and stuck to it (but faking would make noultimate difference). The differences show up the order of theobservational errors (which naturally improve with the years somethingseems to have gone badly wrong in 1789); these are absolute, notrelative (thus the probable absolute error in <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{1} - \delta_{2}\)</span> is the samewhether <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{1} - \delta_{2}\)</span> is0.5" or 90"). It is worth while to work to 0.1" and to the number ofdecimal places used in what follows, even though the last place isdoubtful.</p><table><colgroup><col style="width: 7%"><col style="width: 21%"><col style="width: 20%"><col style="width: 7%"><col style="width: 20%"><col style="width: 23%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">Year</th><th style="text-align: center;">Observed <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span></th><th style="text-align: center;">Smooth Curve</th><th style="text-align: center;">Year</th><th style="text-align: center;">Observed <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span></th><th style="text-align: center;">Smooth Curve</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">1780</td><td style="text-align: center;">3.5</td><td style="text-align: center;">3.5</td><td style="text-align: center;">1813</td><td style="text-align: center;">22.0</td><td style="text-align: center;">22.8</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">1783</td><td style="text-align: center;">8.5</td><td style="text-align: center;">8.5</td><td style="text-align: center;">1816</td><td style="text-align: center;">22.9</td><td style="text-align: center;">22.5</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">1786</td><td style="text-align: center;">12.4</td><td style="text-align: center;">12.5</td><td style="text-align: center;">1819</td><td style="text-align: center;">20.7</td><td style="text-align: center;">22.0</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">1789</td><td style="text-align: center;">19.0</td><td style="text-align: center;">15.8</td><td style="text-align: center;">1822</td><td style="text-align: center;">21.0</td><td style="text-align: center;">21.0</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">1792</td><td style="text-align: center;">18.7</td><td style="text-align: center;">18.3</td><td style="text-align: center;">1825</td><td style="text-align: center;">18.2</td><td style="text-align: center;">18.1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">1795</td><td style="text-align: center;">21.4</td><td style="text-align: center;">20.3</td><td style="text-align: center;">1828</td><td style="text-align: center;">10.8</td><td style="text-align: center;">10.3</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">1798</td><td style="text-align: center;">21.0</td><td style="text-align: center;">21.6</td><td style="text-align: center;">1831</td><td style="text-align: center;">-4.0</td><td style="text-align: center;">-4.0</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">1801</td><td style="text-align: center;">22.2</td><td style="text-align: center;">22.4</td><td style="text-align: center;">1834</td><td style="text-align: center;">-20.8</td><td style="text-align: center;">-20.8</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">1804</td><td style="text-align: center;">24.2</td><td style="text-align: center;">22.8</td><td style="text-align: center;">1837</td><td style="text-align: center;">-42.7</td><td style="text-align: center;">-42.5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">1807</td><td style="text-align: center;">22.1</td><td style="text-align: center;">23.0</td><td style="text-align: center;">1840</td><td style="text-align: center;">-66.6</td><td style="text-align: center;">-66.6</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">1810</td><td style="text-align: center;">23.2</td><td style="text-align: center;">23.0</td><td style="text-align: center;">1843(e)</td><td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">\(-\)</span></td><td style="text-align: center;">-94.0</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Table 1</p><p>The value for 1843 is an extrapolation; results derived from it arelabelled '(e)'.</p><p>An 'effect' due to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is of'order <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in mathematical notation<span class="math inline">\(O(m)\)</span>; if, for a particular quantity<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, X$ denotes (calculated <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) —— (observed <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>), then any <span class="math inline">\(\Delta X\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(O(m)\)</span>.
