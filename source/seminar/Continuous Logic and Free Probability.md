**Basic continuous model theory**

I will discuss continuous logic and show how it can be used to extend Voiculescu's free entropy of microstates to model-theoretic types. I will also present some results and open problems related to the analogy between microstates and types.

在本报告中，我将探讨连续逻辑，并展示如何利用它将 Voiculescu 的自由微态熵推广至模型论类型。此外，我将介绍关于微态与类型类比方面的现有研究成果和未解之谜。

**Central limit theorem for mesoscopic eigenvalue statistics of the free sum of matrices**

This paper studies the central limit theorem (CLT) for mesoscopic eigenvalue statistics of the free sum of random matrices. Consider matrices of the form:
$$H_N = A_N + U_N B_N U_N^*,$$
where $A_N, B_N$ are deterministic Hermitian matrices, and $U_N$ is a Haar-distributed random unitary (or orthogonal) matrix. The focus is on linear eigenvalue statistics:
$$\sum_{i=1}^N g\left(\frac{\lambda_i - E}{\eta}\right) - \mathbb{E}\sum_{i=1}^N g\left(\frac{\lambda_i - E}{\eta}\right)$$
within the mesoscopic regime $N^{-1} \ll \eta \ll 1$ in the regular bulk of the spectrum. The main result establishes convergence to a centered Gaussian random variable with variance:
$$\frac{1}{2\beta\pi^2} \int_{\mathbb{R}}\int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{(g(x_1) - g(x_2))^2}{(x_1 - x_2)^2} dx_1 dx_2 = \frac{1}{\beta\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} |\xi||\hat{g}(\xi)|^2 d\xi,
$$
where $\beta = 2$ (unitary case) or $\beta = 1$ (orthogonal case). The proof uses:

- Characteristic function analysis of linear statistics.

- Ward identities from Haar measure invariance.

- Local laws for resolvents, e.g., $|G_{ij}(z) - \frac{1}{a_i - \omega_B(z)}\delta_{ij}| \prec \frac{1}{\sqrt{N|\eta|}}$.

- Analytic subordination properties of free additive convolution:
$$F_{\mu_A}(\omega_B(z)) = F_{\mu_B}(\omega_A(z)), \quad F_\mu(z) = -1/m_\mu(z).$$
Extensions include:

- Orthogonal conjugation case ($H_N = A + OBO^T$).

- Edge behavior with modified variance and bias terms. 

This work connects to universality in random matrix theory and free probability, providing a unified framework for mesoscopic fluctuations.

**Simultaneous diagonalisable adjoint operators: A finite sample study**

This work is based on the proper orthogonal decomposition or Karhunen-Lo\'eve theorem for stochastic processes. Four canonical digonal forms $T_{1}$, $T_{1\frac{1}{2}}$, $T_{2}$ and $T_{3}$ are considered.

- Four matrix normal distributions are introduced, extending the separable covariance $\varPhi \otimes  \varPsi$ with potentially variable-level ($\varPsi$) and/or sample-level ($\varPhi$) correlations. 

- The corresponding Wishart distribution, matrix $t$-distribution, matrix $F$-distribution are considered in the finte sample case. Several well-known results, including the non-central Wishart distribution and normal quadratic forms, now appear as corollaries.

- Distributions of the largest and smallest roots in principle component analysis and analysis of variance are calculated, with discussion of future extensions to large sample studies.

**Asymptotic property C for certain wreath-like products of groups** 

In this paper, we present generalizations of some results on the asymptotic property C for wreath products. Specifically, we prove that certain wreath-like products admit asymptotic property C, thus providing some new examples for further studies.

**The free probability approach to random matrices**

This report offers an introduction to the powerful framework of free probability and its profound applications in random matrix theory. We will explore how the classical limit theorems, such as Wigner's semicircle law, find their natural explanation within this framework. The core concept of freeness - a non-commutative analogue of independence - will be introduced to explain the asymptotic behavior of large-dimensional random matrices. We will demonstrate how key tools like the R-transform and S-transform allow for the computation of limiting spectral distributions of sums and products of independent matrices through the operations of free additive and multiplicative convolution. This overview aims to illustrate why free probability has become the indispensable language for modern random matrix analysis.

**The circular law of random combination matrices** 

This presentation will discuss recent findings on the spectral characteristics of $n\times n$ random combinatorial matrices $M_n$, where each row is chosen independently and uniformly from the set of binary vectors containing exactly $d$ ones. Our research addresses two fundamental aspects of these matrices: the behavior of their smallest singular value and their limiting empirical spectral distribution (ESD).
 
Firstly,  we establish the circular law for $M_n$ under specific sparsity conditions. For $\log^2 n\le d\le n/2$, we show that the ESD of an appropriately normalized version of $M_n$ converges in probability to the uniform distribution on the unit disk in the complex plane. A crucial ingredient in this proof involves deriving quantitative lower tail bounds for the smallest singular value of the shifted matrices $M_n-zI_n$.
 
Secondly, we investigate the smallest singular value $s_n(M_n)$ in the dense regime, where $d=pn$ for a fixed constant $p\in (0, 1/2]$. We establish a probabilistic upper bound for $s_n(M_n)$. This result complements existing lower bounds of the order $\Omega(n^{-1/2})$ and confirms that $s_n(M_n)$ is typically of the order $n^{-1/2}$ in this dense setting. These results are joint work with Dongbin Li and Alexander Litvak.

**Hrushovski construction in ordered fields**

The Hrushovski construction is a variant of amalgamation methods. It was invented to construct new examples of strongly minimal theories. The method was later adapted to expansions of fields, including colored fields and powered fields. In this talk, I will present my attempt to apply the Hrushovski construction to ordered fields. I will construct an expansion of RCF by a dense multiplicative subgroup (green points). The construction induces a back-and-forth system, enabling us to study the dp-rank and the open core of this structure. I will also introduce my recent progress on powered fields, an expansion of RCF by "power functions" on the unit circle, and my plan to axiomatize expansions of the real field using the Hrushovski construction.

**Approximate message passing algorithms for rotaionally invariant matrices**

Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms have seen widespread use across a variety of applications. However, the precise forms for their Onsager corrections and state evolutions depend on properties of the underlying random matrix ensemble, limiting the extent to which AMP algorithms derived for white noise may be applicable to data matrices that arise in practice. In this work, we study more general AMP algorithms for random matrices W that satisfy orthogonal rotational invariance in law, where W may have a spectral distribution that is different from the semicircle and Marcenko-Pastur laws characteristic of white noise. The Onsager corrections and state evolutions in these algorithms are defined by the free cumulants or rectangular free cumulants
of the spectral distribution of W. Their forms were derived previously by Opper, Cakmak, and Winther using non-rigorous dynamic functional theory techniques, and we provide rigorous proofs.

**Edge statistics of random band matrices**

Random band matrices are interpolation models between Wigner matrices and random Schr\"odinger operators. When the bandwidth changes at different rates relative to the system size, the eigenvalues of band matrices exhibit two distinct behaviors: Wigner matrix eigenvalue statistics and Poisson eigenvalue statistics.

In this talk, we consider the edge statistics of band matrices and discuss the mechanism behind the transition between Wigner statistics and Poisson statistics of eigenvalues. Our discussion involves a type of Feynman diagram expansion and Feynman integral estimates. This discussion is based on collaborative work with Professor Dang-Zheng Liu (USTC), arxiv:2401.00492.
