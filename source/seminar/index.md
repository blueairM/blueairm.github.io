**The Combinatorics of Flagged Weyl Characters**

In this talk, we introduce two aspects of flagged Weyl charcters, which can be restricted to Schubert polynomials. One is about coefficient-wise upper bounds and lower bounds of flagged Weyl charcters. This settles two conjectures proposed by MÃ©szÃ¡ros-St. Dizier-Tanjaya. The other one is about the principal specialization of Schubert polynomials, which improves the results previously obtained by Weigandt, Gao, and MÃ©szÃ¡ros-St. Dizier-Tanjaya.

**Extreme Value Theory of Long-Range Dependent Sequences** 

In a long-range dependent setting, extreme values of a stationary processes exhibit both macroscopic and microscopic clustering features. Such an extremal clustering is subject to the dependence structure as well as the marginal distribution. In this talk, I will introduce the mechanism of a class of long-range dependent time series and its unique extremal behaviors. The talk is based on the following two articles.

[1]	Extremal clustering under moderately long range dependence and moderately heavy tails, Z. Chen and G. Samorodnitsky, Stochastic Processes and Their Applications, 2022.

[2]	Moderately Heavy Extreme Values under Extreme Long Range Dependence, Z. Chen, arXiv: 2505.23103.

**Mirror Construction for Nakajima Quiver Varieties**

In this paper, we construct the ADHM quiver representations and the corresponding sheaves as the mirror objects of formal deformations of the framed immersed Lagrangian sphere decorated with flat bundles. More generally, we construct Nakajima quiver varieties as localized mirrors of framed nodal unions of Lagrangian spheres in dimension two. This produces a mirror functor from the Fukaya category of a framed plumbing of surfaces to the dg category of complexes of bundles over the corresponding Nakajima quiver varieties.

For affine ADE quivers in specific multiplicities, the corresponding (unframed) Lagrangian immersions are homological tori, whose moduli of stable deformations are asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. We show that framed stable Lagrangian branes are transformed into monadic complexes of framed torsion-free sheaves over the ALE spaces.

A main ingredient is the notion of framed Lagrangian immersions and their Maurer-Cartan deformations. Moreover, using the formalism of quiver algebroid stacks, we find isomorphisms between the moduli of stable Lagrangian immersions and that of special Lagrangian fibers of an SYZ fibration in the affine $A_n$ cases.

**Weak coupling limit of a Brownian particle in the curl of the 2D GFF**

We study the weak coupling limit of the following equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$: $$dX_t^\varepsilon=\frac{\hat{\lambda}}{\sqrt{\log\frac1\varepsilon}}\omega^\varepsilon(X_t^\varepsilon)dt+\nu dB_t,\quad X_0^\varepsilon=0. $$ Here $\omega^\varepsilon=\nabla^{\perp}\rho_\varepsilon*\xi$ with $\xi$ representing the $2d$ Gaussian Free Field (GFF) and $\rho_\varepsilon$ denoting an appropriate identity. $B_t$ denotes a two-dimensional standard Brownian motion, and $\hat{\lambda},\;\nu>0$ are two given constants. We use the approach from \cite{Cannizzaro.2023} to show that the second moment of $X_t^\varepsilon$ under the annealed law converges to $(c(\nu,\hat\lambda)^2+2\nu^2)t$ with a precisely determined constant $c(\nu,\hat\lambda)>0$, which implies a non-trivial limit of the drift terms as $\varepsilon$ vanishes. We also prove that in this weak coupling regime, the sequence of solutions converges in distribution to $\left(\sqrt{\frac{c(\nu,\hat\lambda)^2}{2}+\nu^2}\right)\widetilde{B}_t$ as $\varepsilon$ vanishes, where $\widetilde{B}_t$ is a two-dimensional standard Brownian motion.

**The rigidity of eigenfunctions's gradient estimates**

We introduce the rigidity results for eigenfunctions on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. We also obtain the Li-Yau gradient estimate on convex domains and prove similar rigidity results.

**Green points in the reals**

We construct an expansion of a real closed field by a multiplicative subgroup adapting Poizat's theory of green points Its theory is strongly dependent, and every open set definable in a model of this theory is semialgebraic. We prove that the real field with a dense family of logarithmic spirals, proposed by Zilber, satisfies our theory.
