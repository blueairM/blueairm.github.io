            <p>Neptune was discovered in 1846 as a result of mathematical
calculation, done independently and practically simultaneously by Adams
and le Verrier. The full story abounds in unexpected twists, and is
complicated by personal matters, some of them rather painful. There is a
fascinating account in Professor W. M. Smart's <strong><em>John Couch
Adams and the Discovery of Neptune</em></strong>, published by the Royal
Astronomical Society, 1947. I am concerned only with limited parts of
the field.</p>
<p>To refresh the reader's memory of what has been said from time to
time about the discovery I will begin with some representative
quotations. In <strong><em>The Story of the Heavens</em></strong> (1886)
Sir Robert Ball has passages:' the name of le Verrier rose to a pinnacle
hardly surpassed in any age or country' ... 'profound meditations for
many months' ... 'long tand arduous labour guided by consummate
mathematical artifice'. The author is not above a bit of popular appeal
in this book —— 'if the ellipse has not the perfect simplicity of the
circle, it has at least the charm of variety ... an outline of perfect
grace, and an association with ennobling conceptions' —— but on Neptune
he is speaking as a professional. An excellent modern book on the
history of astronomy has, so late as 1938:' probably the most daring
mathematical enterprise of the century ... this amazing task, like which
nothing had ever been attempted before'.</p>
<p>The immediate reaction was natural enough. Celestial Mechanics in
general, and the theory of perturbations in particular, had developed
into a very elaborate and high-brow subject; the problem of explaining
the misbehaviour of Uranus by a new planet was one of 'inverse' theory,
and the common feeling was that the problem was difficult up to or
beyond the point of impossibility. One might speculate at some length on
reasons for this opinion (one, perhaps was confusion between different
meanings of the technica term 'insoluble'<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>).
When Adams and le Verrier provec the opinion wrong (and after all
<strong><em>any</em></strong> mathematical proof is a debunking of
sorts) there was still something to be said for the principle that
difficulties are what they seem before the event, not after. Certainly
no one would grudge them their resounding fame. (Nor grudge, at a lower
level, the luck of a discovery which makes a more sensational impact
than its actual difficulty strictly merits; in point of fact this luck
never does happen to the second-rate.) If the discovery has had a very
long run one must remember that there is a time-lag ; people cannot be
always reconsidering opinions, and having said something once even the
most intelligent tend to go on repeating it. The phrase was still in
vogue that 'only 3 people understand Relativity' at a time when
Eddington was complaining that the trouble about Relativity as an
examination subject in 'Part III' was that it was such a soft
option.</p>
<p>In what I am going to say I am far from imputing stupidity to people
certainly less stupid than myself. My little <strong><em>jeuz
d'esprit</em></strong> are not going to hurt anyone, and I refuse to be
deterred by the fear of being thought disrespectful to great men. I have
not been alone in a lurking suspicion that a much simpler approach might
succeed. On the one hand, aim at the minimum needed to make
observational discovery practicable; specifically at the time <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> of conjunction.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> On
the other, forget the high-brow and laborious perturbation theory, and
try 'school mathematics'. (I admit to the human weakness of being
spurred on by the mild piquancy success would have.) To begin with I
found things oddly elusive (and incidentally committed some gross
stupidities). In the end an absurdly simple line emerged: I can imagine
its being called a dirty trick, nor would I deny that there is some
truth in the accusation. The only way to make my case is to carry out
the actual 'prediction' of <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>
from the observational data, with all the cards on the table (so that
anyone can check against unconscious or conscious faking). I will also
write so as to take as many amateurs as possible with me on the little
adventure.</p>
<p>A planetary 'orbit' is an ellipse with the Sun <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> at a focus, and the radius vector <span class="math inline">\(SP\)</span> sweeps out area at a constant rate
(Kepler's second law). An orbit, given its plane, is defined by 4
elements, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. The first 3 define the
geometrical ellipse: <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the
semi-major axis; <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> the
eccentricity; <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> the longitude
of perihelion, i.e. with the obvious polar coordinates <span class="math inline">\(r, \theta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the 'longitude' and <span class="math inline">\(\theta=a\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is nearest <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (at an end of the major axis). When we
know <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> we know the 'mean angular
velocity' <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and the associated
period <span class="math inline">\(p= 2 \pi/n\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is in fact proportional to <span class="math inline">\(a^{-\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> (Kepler's third law)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>; further the constant rate of area
sweeping is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}abn\)</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and twice this rate is identical
with the angular momentum'<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> (a.m. for short); this
has the differential calculus formula <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\theta\)</span>, and it also is of course
constant. The 4th element, the 'epoch' <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, is needed to identify the origin of
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>; the exact definition is that
<span class="math inline">\(\theta= \alpha\)</span> (perihelion) occurs
at the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(nt+ \epsilon = \alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>'s orbit has a period of 84
years, and an eccentricity <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> of
about <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{20}\)</span>. The effects of
bodies other than <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> can be allowed for, after which we may
suppose that <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and the eventual <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> are the only bodies in the system; we
may also suppose (all this is common form) that the movements are all in
one plane. The values of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>
(for <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>) at the various times <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (we sometimes write <span class="math inline">\(\theta(t)\)</span> to emphasize that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is 'at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>') may be regarded as the observational
raw material (though of course the actual raw observations are made from
the Earth). The <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>'s for the various
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are indirect and are much less
well determined.</p>
<p>The position in 1845 was that no exact elliptic orbit would fit the
observed 6 over the whole stretch 1780 to 1840.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The
discrepancies are very small, mostly a few seconds of arc (with a sudden
swoop of about 90",see Tablel). The ratio <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>'s mass to that of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (taken as 1) is actually about 1/19000
(the Orders of magnitude fit since m radians is about 11").</p>
<p>In the absence of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> the a.m.
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is constant (as stated above
alias of Kepler's second law); <strong><em>the actual <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> accelerates <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at times earlier than <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> and decelerates it at later
times</em></strong>. The graph of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
against <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> therefore rises to a
maximum at <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{0}\)</span>, and my first
idea was that this would identify. So it would if all observations were
without error (and the method would have the theoretical advantage of
being unaffected by the eccentricities). But the value of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> depends on the <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and the determinations of the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>'s are consequently too uncertain.
Though the method fails it rises from the ashes in another form. For
this a few more preliminaries are needed.</p>
<p>The numerical data Adams and le Verrier had to work on were not the
observed <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>'s themselves, but
the differences between the observed <span class="math inline">\(\theta(t)\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{B}(t)\)</span> of an elliptic orbit
calculated by Bouvard; the 'discrepancy' <span class="math inline">\(\delta(t)\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> for short) is <span class="math inline">\(\delta(t)=\theta(t)-\theta_{B}(t)\)</span>. [<span class="math inline">\(\theta_{B} (t)\)</span> depends on the 'elements'
of <span class="math inline">\(E_{B}\)</span>, and these are subject to
'errors'. These errors are among the unknowns that the perturbation
theory has to determine: our method does not mind what they are, as we
shall see.] Table I gives the raw <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>'s (given in Adams's paper<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>),
together with the values got by running a smooth curve. The treatment of
the start of the sudden swoop down after the long flat stretch is a bit
uncertain: I drew my curve and stuck to it (but faking would make no
ultimate difference). The differences show up the order of the
observational errors (which naturally improve with the years something
seems to have gone badly wrong in 1789); these are absolute, not
relative (thus the probable absolute error in <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{1} - \delta_{2}\)</span> is the same
whether <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{1} - \delta_{2}\)</span> is
0.5" or 90"). It is worth while to work to 0.1" and to the number of
decimal places used in what follows, even though the last place is
doubtful.</p>

<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, X$ denotes (calculated <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) —— (observed <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>), then any <span class="math inline">\(\Delta X\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(O(m)\)</span>. The square of this (2nd order of
infinitesimals) is extremely minute and everyone neglects it
instinctively (if <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> watch loses 10
seconds a day you don't try to correct for the further loss over the
lost 10 seconds the cases are comparable). Next, an effect of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is what it would be if <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, and also <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, moved in circles,
<strong><em>plus</em></strong> a 'correction' for the actual
eccentricities of the orbits. <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>'s
eccentricity <span class="math inline">\(e(\frac{1}{20})\)</span> is
unusually large and it would be reasonable to expect <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>'s to be no larger (it is actually less
than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{100}\)</span>). The <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>'s distort the 'circular' value of the
effect by 5 per cent, (or say a maximum of 10 per cent.); the
'distortion' of the effect is <span class="math inline">\(O(em)\)</span>, the effect itself being <span class="math inline">\(O(m)\)</span>. I propose to ignore things of order
<span class="math inline">\(O(em)\)</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>:
this is the first step in my argument. In particular, when we have
something which is either some <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> itself, multiplied by a factor, we can
substitute first approximations (i.e. with <span class="math inline">\(e=0\)</span>), or make convenient changes that are
<span class="math inline">\(O(e)\)</span>, in the factor.</p>
<p>Suppose now that <span class="math inline">\(E_{l}, E_{2}\)</span>
are two (exact) elliptic orbits, yielding <span class="math inline">\(\theta(t)\)</span>'s that differ by amounts of the
kind we are concerned with, differing, that is, by <span class="math inline">\(O(m)\)</span>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> It is now the case that
the differences satisfy the equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\theta_{1} - \theta_{2} = m( a + bt + c \cos nt + d \sin nt) + O(em)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c, d\)</span> are constants
depending on the two sets of elements of <span class="math inline">\(E_{1}, E_{2}\)</span>, and (following our
agreement about <strong><em>factors</em></strong> of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
is any common approximation to the mean angular velocity. I will
postpone the school mathentatics proof of this.</p>
<p>Next, (i) let <span class="math inline">\(E^{*}\)</span> be the
'instantaneous orbit at time <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>', that is to say the orbit that
<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> would describe if <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> were annihilated at time <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>: note that <span class="math inline">\(E^{*}\)</span> shares with <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> the property of being 'unknown'.
(ii) Let <span class="math inline">\(\vartheta\)</span> be the
perturbation of the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> produced by <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> since time <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
Then if, at any time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is (as usual) <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>'s longitude, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{B}\)</span> is the longitude in the orbit
<span class="math inline">\(E_{B}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{*}\)</span> the longitude in the orbit
<span class="math inline">\(E^{*}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\vartheta = \theta - \theta^{*}\)</span>, and
so</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\delta(t) = \theta - \theta_{B} = (\theta^{*} - \theta_{B}) + \vartheta
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Now everything in this has a factor <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and we may omit any stray <span class="math inline">\(O(em)\)</span>'s. In particular, we may in
calculating <span class="math inline">\(\vartheta\)</span> drop any
<span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> terms. But this means that
<strong><em>we can calculate <span class="math inline">\(\vartheta\)</span> as if both <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>'s and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>'s orbits were circles</em></strong>.
When, however, the orbits are circles, <strong><em><span class="math inline">\(\vartheta\)</span> has equal and opposite values
at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>'s on equal and opposite sides
of <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span></em></strong>; in other
words, <strong><em>if we write <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{0} +
\tau\)</span>, then</em></strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\vartheta(t) = \Omega (\tau)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><strong><em>where <span class="math inline">\(\Omega (\tau)\)</span>
is an odd<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> function of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>; i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(-\tau)=
-\Omega(\tau)\)</span>.</em></strong></p>
<p>This, used in combination with (1) and (2), is the essential (and
very simple) point of the argument. The difference <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{*} - \theta_{B}\)</span> is a special case
of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{1} - \theta_{2}\)</span> in (1).
Write <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{0} + \tau\)</span> in (1) and
combine this with (2) and (3); this gives, ignoring <span class="math inline">\(O(em)\)</span>'s,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta(t_{0} + \tau) = m \left\{a + b
t_{0} + b \tau + c \cos (nt_{0} + n \tau) + d \sin (nt_{0} + n \tau)
\right\} + \Omega(\tau)\]</span></p>
<p>Expanding the <span class="math inline">\(\cos\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sin\)</span> of sums and rearranging we have
(with new constants, whose values vary with but do not concern us)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta(t_{0} + \tau) = A - B(1 - \cos
n\tau) + \left\{C \tau + D \sin n\tau +
\Omega(\tau)\right\}\]</span></p>
<p><strong><em>The curly bracket is an odd function of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span></em></strong>. Hence if we combine
equal and opposite <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> and
construct <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{*}(\tau)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\rho(\tau)\)</span> to satisfy</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta^{*}(\tau) = - \frac{1}{2}
\left\{\delta(t_{0}+\tau) + \delta(t_{0}- \tau) - 2 \delta(t_{0})
\right\}, \rho(\tau) = \delta^{*}(\tau)/(1-\cos n\tau)\]</span></p>
<p>we have <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{*}(\tau)=B( 1 - \cos
n\tau)\)</span>, and so $()=B $ for all <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. <strong><em>If, then, we are using
the right <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> the ratio p(r) must
come out constant</em></strong>: this is our method for identifying
<span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>. The actual value of <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> to the nearest year is 1822.</p>
<p>Table II, in which the unit of time is 1 year (and the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\cos
n\tau\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(2\pi/84\)</span>), shows
the results of trying various (the century is omitted from the dates).
The last place of decimals for the <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\tau)\)</span> is not reliable, but of course
gets better as the size of the entry <span class="math inline">\(2\delta^{*}(\tau)\)</span> increases: I give the
numbers as they came, and they speak for themselves. <span class="math inline">\(\tau=6\)</span> is included, though the
proportionate error in <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{*}\)</span>
is then considerable.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> For <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}=13\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> goes on to 34.8 at <span class="math inline">\(\tau=27\)</span>; for <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}=16\)</span> it goes to 38.2 at <span class="math inline">\(\tau= 24\)</span>. Once the data the smooth curve
values were assembled the calculations took a mere hour or so with a
slide-rule. The date 1822-4 seems about the 'best' <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>.</p>

<p>We need fairly large <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> for
<span class="math inline">\(\delta^{*}(\tau)\)</span> to have enough
ignificant figures, and further to provide a range showing up whether
<span class="math inline">\(\rho(\tau)\)</span> is constant or not. And
we need room to manoeuvre round the final. So the method depends on the
'luck' that 1822 falls comfortably inside the period of observation
1780-1840. But some luck was needed in any case.</p>
<p>It is an important point that the method is quite indifferent to how
well <span class="math inline">\(E_{B}\)</span> does its originally
intended job, and <strong><em>we do not need to know (and I don't knoiv)
its elements</em></strong>; it is enough to know the 'discrepancy' with
<strong><em>some</em></strong>, 'unknown', orbit (not too bad of
course). On the other hand the method ostentatiously says nothing at all
about the mass or distance of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. I
will add something on this. With <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>-terms ignored <span class="math inline">\(\vartheta(\tau)/m\)</span> can be calculated
<strong><em>exactly</em></strong> for any given value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=a/a_{1}\)</span> (ratio of the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>'s of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>)<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The idea would be to
try different <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>'s, each <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to give a best fitting <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and to take the best fitting
<strong><em>pair</em></strong> <span class="math inline">\(\lambda,
m\)</span>. This fails, because the greater part of <span class="math inline">\(\vartheta\)</span> is of the form <span class="math inline">\(b^{\prime}(n\tau - \sin n\tau)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b^{\prime}\)</span> is smothered by the <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c, d\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{*} - \theta_{B}\)</span>, which depend on
the unknown elements of <span class="math inline">\(E_{B}\)</span>
(<span class="math inline">\(\vartheta\)</span> is smothered by the
'unknown' <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{*} - \theta_{B}\)</span>).
If we knew these elements (or equivalently the raw <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) we might be able to go on. They
could be recovered from the Paris Observatory archives; but this article
is a last moment addition to the book, I do not feel that I am on full
professional duty, and in any case we should be losing the light-hearted
note of our adventure.</p>
<p>The time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> once known, it would
be necessary to guess a value for <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>'s distance <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>'s period is then <span class="math inline">\(84(a_{1}/a)^{\frac{3}{2}}\)</span> years, and we
could 'predict' <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>'s place in 1846.
The obvious first guess in 1846 was <span class="math inline">\(a_{l}/a=2\)</span>, following Bode's empirical
law, to which N is maliciously the first exception, the true value being
1.58. Adams and le Verrier started with 2 (Adams coming down to 1.942
for a second round). Since from our standpoint<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
too large an <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span> has
disproportionately bad results as against one too small, it would be
reasonable to try 1.8. This would give a prediction (for 1846) about
10<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span> out, but the sweep
needed would be wholly practicable.</p>
<p>Le Verrier was less than 1<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span> out (Adams between 2<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span> and 3<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>); 'they pointed the telescope
and saw the planet'. This very close, and double, prediction is a
curiosity. All the observations from 1780 to 1840 were used, and on an
equal footing, and the theory purported to say where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> was over this whole stretch. With a
wrong <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span> they could be right at
1840 only by being wrong at 1780. With Adams's <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}=1.94a\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>'s period (which depends on <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span> only) would be 227 years; he would
have been wrong by 30<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span> for
1780 if the orbit were circular, and so the angular velocity uniform.
But faced with a wrong <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span> the
method responded gallantly by putting up a large eccentricity (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{8}\)</span>), and assigning perihelion to
the place of conjunction. The combination makes the effective distance
from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> over the critical stretch
more like <span class="math inline">\(1.7 a_{l}\)</span>, and the
resulting error at 1780 (the worst one) was only 18. (A mass 2.8 times
too large was a more obvious adjustment.)</p>
<p>In much more recent times small discrepancies for <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>'s being in fact the more manageable
ones) were analysed for a trans-Neptunian planet, and the planet Pluto
was found in 1930 near the predicted place. This was a complete fluke:
Pluto has a mass probably no more than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{10}\)</span> of the Earth's; any effects
it could have on <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> would be hopelessly swamped by the
observational errors.</p>
<p>It remains for me to give the (school mathematics) proof of (1)
above. Call <span class="math inline">\(e_{1} - e_{2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta e\)</span>, and so on. I said above that
all <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>'s were <span class="math inline">\(O(m)\)</span>: this is not quite true, though my
deception has been in the reader's best interests, and will not have led
him astray.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> It is true, and common sense, for
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta n\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon\)</span>. But the 'effect' of a
given Aa vanishes when <span class="math inline">\(e=0\)</span>, and is
proportional to <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. So it is <span class="math inline">\(e\Delta \alpha\)</span>, not <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \alpha\)</span>, that is comparable with
the other <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>'s and so <span class="math inline">\(O(m)\)</span>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>We start from two well-known formulae. The first is geometrical; the
polar equation of the ellipse of the orbit is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
r = a(1- e^{2}) ( 1 +e \cos (\theta -a))^{-1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The second is dynamical; the equation of angular momentum (Kepler's
second law) is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}r^{2} \frac{d\theta}{dt}
= na^{2} (1-e^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>So, using dots for time differentiations,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\theta = n(1-e^{2})^{-\frac{3}{2}} [1 - 2\cos (\theta -a) + 3e^{2}
\cos^{2} (\theta -a ) + \cdots]
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The first approximation (with <span class="math inline">\(e=0\)</span>) is <span class="math inline">\(\theta=nt + \epsilon\)</span>. We take suffixes 1
and 2 in (6) and operate with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, remembering that we may take
first approximations in any <strong><em>factor</em></strong> of an <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>In estimating <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\theta\)</span> we
may, with error <span class="math inline">\(O(em)\)</span>, ignore the
factor <span class="math inline">\((1-e^{2})^{-\frac{3}{2}}\)</span> in
(6), since it is itself <span class="math inline">\(\left(1+O(e^{2})\right)\)</span>, and its <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(O(e\Delta e)=O(em)\)</span>. We have, therefore,
with error <span class="math inline">\(O(em)\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta \theta = \Delta \left\{n[\quad
]\right\} = [\quad ] \Delta n + n \Delta [\quad ]\]</span></p>
<p>The 1st term is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta n+O(em)\)</span>.
The 2nd is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n\left[\Delta e \left\{- 2 \cos(\theta
-a ) + O(e)\right\} + \Delta (\theta -a ) \left\{2e \sin (\theta -a ) +
O(e^{2}\right\}\right]\]</span></p>
<p>and we may drop the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta (\theta - a)\)</span> on account of
the factor <span class="math inline">\(O(\epsilon)\)</span>. Summing up,
we obtain</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta \theta = m (A+B \cos (\theta -a )
+ C \sin (\theta -a ) ) + O(em)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(mA=\Delta n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(mB = -2n\Delta e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(mC = -2n(e\Delta a)\)</span>. Substituting the
first approximation <span class="math inline">\(\theta=nt +
\epsilon\)</span> in the right hand side, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta \theta = m (A+B \cos (nt +
\epsilon -a ) + C \sin (nt + \epsilon -a ) ) + O(em)\]</span></p>
<p>and integration then gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta \theta = m (A+B/n \sin (nt +

distortion in the value found for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>
is, however, a sort of exception to this. But the effect of <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>'s in distorting <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> is unlikely to be worse than the
separation they create between time of conjunction and time of closest
approach. An easy calculation shows that this last time difference is at
worst 0-8 years.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

'by symmetry': alternatively, <strong><em>reverse</em></strong> the
motions from time <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>. (The

completely negligible as might be supposed.)<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

allowing different masses to the two 'Suns'. The point is relevant to
certain subtleties, into which I will not enter.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
